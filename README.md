# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 
When designing a game, there are a lot of decisions to make, including how the gameplay mechanics will work. In the case of the game being discussed here, there was a choice between allowing the player to choose a random place for their gamepiece to land or using a random number generator. While the former option may have seemed like a fun idea, it quickly became apparent that it would be too complicated to implement in a text-based game. There would have been too many variables to consider and it would have been difficult to ensure that the game remained fair for all players.

As a result, the decision was made to use a random number generator to determine where the player's gamepiece would land. This is a much simpler approach that still allows for an element of chance in the game. However, to make the gameplay more interesting, the player is also given a question to answer when they land on a tile. This not only adds an additional challenge to the game, but it also helps to ensure that the player remains engaged and interested in the gameplay. Ultimately, the goal is to create a fun and engaging game experience for the player, and the decision to use a random number generator with a question element is a step in that direction.

Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered) We could have let the player to roll the dice, but because the game is a text-based program, it seemed impractical.

-- What was your overall approach to tackling this project? Because we had to build the code in an OOP system, we had to figure out the assembling of our game – specifically how tiles, questions, and answers relate to each other – before we started our program. Also, we had to figure out the association between the ASCII arts and the Action class.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project? Random methods, ASCII art, and storing values in lists are few new things that we learned during our completion of this project.
Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently? If it wasn’t text-based, we feel like we could have added more visualization and easier/ inticing user interface for our game.
If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement? Sound, graphics, and more detailed exploration when the player gets to the good/bad/medium places are what we would have liked to implement in our game.
What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you? Jordan - he suggested that we utilize a list, which helped us remove a roadblock in our project.
If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give? Use lists, go to office hours, ask for help from our peers, and be open to suggestions are the main takeaways from our project.
If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project. We did pair programming and contributed equally to the project. Moreover, we both debugged roadblocks that appeared during our programming. We are the Chidi-Eleanor couple in this world!!!
